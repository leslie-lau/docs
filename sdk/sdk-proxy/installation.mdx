* Raw Source (Go)
* Docker Image
* OS Packaged Binary

The raw source can be used if building a custom image is required, or if you need to build a custom binary for your environment that will use the exposed API to instantiate the proxy.

We recommend using the OS packaged version for easy future upgrades and management.

## Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")

### Debian based[​](#debian-based "Direct link to Debian based")

```
sudo dpkg -i devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy_*.debsudo apt-get install -f
```

### RPM based[​](#rpm-based "Direct link to RPM based")

```
sudo rpm -i devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy_*.rpm
```

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

A sample config.json file is included in the package and can be found at `/etc/devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy/config.json.example`. The most current version of the file can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/local-bucketing-proxy/blob/main/config.json.example).

Alternatively - it can be configured via environment variables. The following environment variables are supported:

### Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

`DVC_LB_PROXY_SDK_KEY` is the only required environment variable if not using a configuration file

## Post-Installation[​](#post-installation "Direct link to Post-Installation")

If you have installed an OS packaged version of the proxy - the binary will be installed to `/usr/bin/devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy`.

You will need to configure a separate supervisor/orchestrator such as `systemd` or `upstart` if no you need to create a long-lived process.

We recommend keeping the logging output of the proxy available as it streams to `stdout` and `stderr` by default. To enable debug http logging, set the `GIN_MODE` environment variable to `debug`.

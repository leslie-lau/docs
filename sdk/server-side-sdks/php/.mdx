description: "Welcome to the DevCycle PHP SDK. There are two modes for the SDK, Cloud bucketing (using the ) and Local Bucketing."
---

We recommend using the Local Bucketing mode by default, as it performs fast local evaluations of your feature flags. If you need access to [EdgeDB](https://docs.devcycle.com/platform/feature-flags/targeting/edgedb) you will need to use the Cloud Bucketing mode of the SDK.

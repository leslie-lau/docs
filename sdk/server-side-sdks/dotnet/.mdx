description: "The DevCycle .NET / C# SDK has two operation modes; Cloud Bucketing - which interfaces with the , and Local Bucketing - which performs bucketing locally."
---

We recommend using the Local Bucketing mode by default, as it performs fast local evaluations of your feature flags. If you need access to [EdgeDB](/platform/feature-flags/targeting/edgedb) you will need to use the Cloud Bucketing mode of the SDK. See [Here](/sdk/features#local-and-cloud-bucketing) for more information.

## Client Side SDKs[​](#client-side-sdks "Direct link to Client Side SDKs")

DevCycle client-side SDKs are meant for single-user contexts, such as web browsers and mobile apps. These SDKs retrieve their configuration for the current user when they are initialized and any time the user is re-identified. They also receive updates in real time when configuration is changed in the DevCycle platform.

The current Client-Side SDKs are:

## Server-Side SDKs[​](#server-side-sdks "Direct link to Server-Side SDKs")

Server-side SDKs are used in multi-user contexts such as backend services, where each call to the SDK will likely be for a different user. The user's ID and any other targeting information must be passed in on every SDK function call.

The current Server-Side SDKs are:

The React Native SDK is available as a package on npm. A separate React Native Expo SDK is available as a package on npm. Both SDKs are also open source and can be viewed on Github.

[![React-Native package version](/images/sdk/client-side-sdks/react-native/npm/v/-devcycle/react-native-client-sdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk) [![Expo package version](/images/sdk/client-side-sdks/react-native/npm/v/-devcycle/react-native-expo-client-sdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devcycle/react-native-expo-client-sdk) [![GitHub](/images/sdk/client-side-sdks/react-native/github/stars/devcyclehq/js-sdks.svg)](https://github.com/devcyclehq/js-sdks)

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

This SDK is compatible with *React Native* version 0.64.0 and above.

<Warning>
  If you are using [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) with React Native versions below `0.75.0`, SSE connections (which power real-time updates) will not work on Android unless Flipper is disabled. See [this issue](https://github.com/binaryminds/react-native-sse/issues/61) for more information.
</Warning>

## React Native Web[​](#react-native-web "Direct link to React Native Web")

To get your React Native Web working with DevCycle, you will need to change one of the rules in the webpack config to include `.cjs` files as one of the file types to be transpiled, e.g.:

```
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require('@expo/webpack-config')module.exports = async function (env, argv) {  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv)  config.module.rules = config.module.rules.map((rule) => {    if (rule.oneOf instanceof Array) {      // add "cjs" as an exclusion to this rule to prevent it from being regarded as an asset      rule.oneOf[rule.oneOf.length - 1].exclude = [        /\.(js|mjs|jsx|cjs|ts|tsx)$/,        /\.html$/,        /\.json$/,      ]    }    return rule  })  return config}
```

## Intro and Experiment Overview[​](#intro-and-experiment-overview "Direct link to Intro and Experiment Overview")

We begin the series by reviewing what we'll cover in the rest of the videos below and go through an example of an experiment overview that outlines the criteria of the experiment we're creating.

## Metric Setup[​](#metric-setup "Direct link to Metric Setup")

In this video, we walk through how to create a new metric from the metrics page, describing how it gets populated and what type of data you can measure with it.

## Feature and Variable Setup[​](#feature-and-variable-setup "Direct link to Feature and Variable Setup")

After creating metrics that we want to use for the experiment, it's time to create the Feature and the variables that will control the experiment.

## Targeting Rule Setup[​](#targeting-rule-setup "Direct link to Targeting Rule Setup")

Continuing with the Feature creation, this video will walk you through setting up targeting rules for your Feature to define the users who should receive the experiment.

## Adding Metrics to Experiment Results[​](#adding-metrics-to-experiment-results "Direct link to Adding Metrics to Experiment Results")

Finishing up, we can add the metrics that were created earlier to the Feature and show you an example of how the data appears in the experiment results section.

That concludes the experiment setup series. Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any questions or if there are other tutorials that you'd like to see!

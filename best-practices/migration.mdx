---

## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Migrating from an existing feature flagging system to a new one can be complex, especially with a large codebase. [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) provides a standardized interface that simplifies this process. This guide outlines best practices for leveraging OpenFeature and its Multi-Provider utility to ensure a smooth transition from your existing feature flagging system to DevCycle.

## Why Use OpenFeature?[​](#why-use-openfeature "Direct link to Why Use OpenFeature?")

### Benefits of OpenFeature[​](#benefits-of-openfeature "Direct link to Benefits of OpenFeature")

* Production-ready SDKs that take care of all the hard stuff with fetching configuration data, error handling, and verifying inputs
* Standard interface that works the same in your code regardless of which provider you use
* Reduced maintenance burden by eliminating a piece of code you have to maintain
* Integration with code analysis and automated cleanup tools designed to look for OpenFeature calls

## Best Practices for Migration[​](#best-practices-for-migration "Direct link to Best Practices for Migration")

### Step 1. Abstract Evaluations[​](#step-1-abstract-evaluations "Direct link to Step 1. Abstract Evaluations")

Instead of directly calling a specific feature flagging solution throughout your code, abstract flag evaluations using OpenFeature.

```
const existingProvider = new ExistingProvider()await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(existingProvider)const openFeatureClient = OpenFeature.getClient();const value = await openFeatureClient.getStringValue(  'flag-key',   'default value',   someUser);
```

### Step 2. Implement the Multi-Provider[​](#step-2-implement-the-multi-provider "Direct link to Step 2. Implement the Multi-Provider")

The Multi-Provider allows you to use multiple underlying providers as sources of flag data for the OpenFeature SDK. When a flag is being evaluated, the Multi-Provider will consult each underlying provider it is managing in order to determine the final result. Different evaluation strategies can be defined to control which providers get evaluated and which result is used.

<Warning>
  The Multi-Provider is currently available only for the NodeJS and Web OpenFeature SDKs
</Warning>

#### SERVER-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION[​](#server-side-implementation "Direct link to SERVER-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION")

##### Install the Multi-Provider package:[​](#install-the-multi-provider-package "Direct link to Install the Multi-Provider package:")

```
npm install @openfeature/multi-provider
```

##### Initialize the Multi-Provider in your code:[​](#initialize-the-multi-provider-in-your-code "Direct link to Initialize the Multi-Provider in your code:")

```
import { MultiProvider } from '@openfeature/multi-provider';import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/server-sdk';import { DevCycleProvider } from '@devcycle/nodejs-server-sdk';// DevCycle Provider Setupconst { DEVCYCLE_SDK_KEY } = process.env;const user = { user_id: "user_id" };const devcycleProvider = new DevCycleProvider(DEVCYCLE_SDK_KEY);// Existing Provider Setupconst existingProvider = new ExistingProvider();// Multi-provider Setupconst multiProvider = new MultiProvider([  { provider: devcycleProvider },  { provider: existingProvider }]);await OpenFeature.setContext(user);await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(multiProvider);const openFeatureClient = OpenFeature.getClient();const value = await openFeatureClient.getStringValue(  'flag-key',  'default value',  someUser);
```

#### CLIENT-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION[​](#client-side-implementation "Direct link to CLIENT-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION")

##### Install the Web Multi-Provider package:[​](#install-the-web-multi-provider-package "Direct link to Install the Web Multi-Provider package:")

```
npm install @openfeature/multi-provider-web
```

##### Initialize the Web Multi-Provider in your code:[​](#initialize-the-web-multi-provider-in-your-code "Direct link to Initialize the Web Multi-Provider in your code:")

```
import { WebMultiProvider } from "@openfeature/multi-provider-web";import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/web-sdk";import DevCycleProvider from "@devcycle/openfeature-web-provider";// DevCycle Provider Setupconst { DEVCYCLE_SDK_KEY } = process.env;const user = { user_id: "user_id" };const devCycleProvider = new DevCycleProvider(DEVCYCLE_SDK_KEY);// Existing Provider Setupconst existingProvider = new ExistingProvider();// Multi-provider Setupconst multiProvider = new WebMultiProvider([  { provider: devCycleProvider },  { provider: existingProvider }]);await OpenFeature.setContext(user);await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(multiProvider);const openFeatureClient = OpenFeature.getClient();const value = await openFeatureClient.getStringValue(  'flag-key',  'default value',  someUser);
```

#### Specifiy DevCycleMigrationStrategy[​](#specifiy-devcyclemigrationstrategy "Direct link to Specifiy DevCycleMigrationStrategy")

The Multi-Provider supports various strategies to control provider evaluation and result determination. The default **FirstMatchStrategy** evaluates providers in order, moving to the next if the current returns `FLAG_NOT_FOUND`. Any error will be thrown by the Multi-Provider and caught by the OpenFeature SDK, returning the default value. This strategy is ideal for migrating providers, preferring the new provider while using the old as a fallback.

While the default strategy is generally recommended for vendor migration, a special **DevCycleMigrationStrategy** has been created specifically for migrating to DevCycle. This strategy extends **FirstMatchStrategy** to accommodate DevCycle's process by returning `DEFAULT` for "flag not found" cases.

##### SERVER-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION[​](#server-side-implementation-1 "Direct link to SERVER-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION")

```
  import { DevCycleMigrationStrategy } from '@devcycle/nodejs-server-sdk/openfeature-strategy'  const multiProvider = new MultiProvider(     [       { provider: devcycleProvider },       { provider: existingProvider }     ],     new DevCycleMigrationStrategy()   );
```

##### CLIENT-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION[​](#client-side-implementation-1 "Direct link to CLIENT-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION")

```
  import { DevCycleMigrationStrategy } from "@devcycle/openfeature-web-provider/strategy";     const multiProvider = new WebMultiProvider(     [       { provider: devcycleProvider },       { provider: existingProvider }     ],     new DevCycleMigrationStrategy()   );
```

<Warning>
  To effectively use this strategy with DevCycle, ensure that all targeting rules include an "All Users" rule. This will prevent the return of `DEFAULT` for known keys.
</Warning>

### Step 3. Port Data[​](#step-3-port-data "Direct link to Step 3. Port Data")

Ensure all your flagging data is ported from your existing provider to DevCycle. This involves transferring flag definitions, user targeting rules, and any associated metadata. You can do this gradually by creating new flags in DevCycle while keeping existing ones in the old system until they are retired. **With that in mind, this transition period can also be seen as an exciting opportunity to clean up all your old flags.**

<Info>
  Did you know the DevCycle team built a [Feature Importer](https://docs.devcycle.com/integrations/feature-importer) to help with this process? It's open source and can be customized to import flags from either internal or 3rd party platforms.
</Info>

To ensure a seamless transition, consider the following best practices:

1. **Audit Your Current Flags:**

* Before migrating, conduct a thorough audit of your existing flags. Identify and document active flags, deprecated flags, and any that can be immediately retired.

2. **Establish a Migration Timeline:**

* Create a detailed timeline for the migration process. Prioritize the migration of critical flags first and schedule non-critical flags for later stages.

3. **Monitor and Validate Post-Migration:**

* After migrating flags, continuously monitor their performance and validate that they function as expected. This ensures any discrepancies can be quickly addressed.

4. **Leverage DevCycle's Analytics:**

* Take advantage of DevCycle's analytics to gain insights into flag performance and user interactions. Use this data to refine your feature flag strategy and optimize user experiences.

By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth transition to DevCycle, taking full advantage of its robust feature management capabilities.

### Step 4. Monitor and Log[​](#step-4-monitor-and-log "Direct link to Step 4. Monitor and Log")

Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance and correctness of flag evaluations. This helps in identifying and resolving any issues during the migration.

### Step 5. Test and Validate[​](#step-5-test-and-validate "Direct link to Step 5. Test and Validate")

Before fully transitioning to DevCycle, conduct thorough testing to ensure that:

* Flag evaluations return expected results.
* Performance is not negatively impacted.
* There are no regressions in existing functionality.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

OpenFeature’s Multi-Provider offers a powerful solution for migrating feature flag systems. By following these best practices, you can ensure a smooth transition from your Existing Provider to DevCycle, minimizing disruptions and maintaining the integrity of your feature flag evaluations.
